# About Me
Hi, my name is Kyle Ray. I am a graduate student researcher in the physics department at UC Davis, working under [James Crutchfield](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/) at the [complexity science center](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/Welcome.html). This site is really my only "online presence", but the main purpose of it is to document interesting or useful coding tricks I pick up while working (mostly for my own reference, though ostensibly for posterity). I also use it to host animations and images to supplement publications, manuscripts, and research projects.
