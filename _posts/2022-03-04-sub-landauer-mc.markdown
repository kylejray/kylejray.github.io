This is a supplemental animation to help visualize the protocol described in the [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07122) of the same name:

Four different projections of the bit swap. (Top Left) The position space projection shows how the degrees of freedom react to the changing potential, depicted by the underlying contours. (Bottom Left) The velocity space projection most clearly shows the departure and eventual return to equilibrium. (Right) Marginal phase space projections in both the computational ɸ and the computationally passive ɸdc dimensions show how the ɸ momenta serves as a transient memory and allows the informational states to avoid crossing in phase space.

The device and protocol simulated for these animations do not represent a particularly efficient device. Instead, a device was selected so that both the swap and the return to equilibrium could be easily seen at relatively similar timescales. For efficient devices, the particles end closer to an equilibrium distribution and the equilibration takes a couple orders of magnitude longer. Even when simulating this higher dissipation device, the time is sped up once the swap is accomplished to avoid an overly long video—an indicator that the dynamics of the swap must happen much faster than thermal equilibration.
