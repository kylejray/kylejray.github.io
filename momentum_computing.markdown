## Momentum Computing

 Momentum Computing is an information-processing paradigm that uses [reversible computing principles](/state_space/) to design control protocols that manipulate dynamically-underdamped memory states. This means positional memory-state dynamics are non-Markovian during computation. One recent physical instantiation with coupled superconducting Josephson devices promises a thousand-fold reduction in the energy required for computing, while sill operating at speeds comparable to todays microprocessors.
