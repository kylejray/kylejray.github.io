## Momentum Computing

Momentum Computing is a computing paradigm that uses [reversible computing sensibilities](/state_space/) to design control protocols that rely on underdamped memory states, which means the positional memory state dynamics are non-markovian during the computation.

- See [here](/fredkin/) for the initial work that proposed the idea and provided idealized proof of concept simulations, and [here](/gslmc/) for a realistic device with acoompanying physically calibrated simulations.
