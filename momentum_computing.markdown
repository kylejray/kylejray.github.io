## Momentum Computing

 "Momentum Computing is an information-processing paradigm that uses [reversible computing principles](/state_space/) to design control protocols that manipulate dynamically-underdamped memory states. This means positional memory-state dynamics are non-Markovian during computation. One recent physical instantiation with coupled superconducting Josephson devices promises a thousand-fold reduction in the energy required for computing, while sill operating at speeds comparable to todays microprocessors.

- See [here](/fredkin/) for the initial work that proposed the idea and provided idealized proof of concept simulations, and [here](/gslmc/) for a realistic device with accompanying physically calibrated simulations.
