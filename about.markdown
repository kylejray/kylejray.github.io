The website is build using the minima theme for jekyll, and is hosted on github pages.

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

This page is part of the template, and I haven't the heart to delete it. It serves a a nice template to remind me how to add pages that are included in the navigation, so it will sit here until I work up the nerve to go it alone without such a guide. Or, perhaps one day I will get a dog and then I can put a picture of it here (though, I find this unlikely).
