Hi, my name is Kyle Ray. I am a graduate student researcher working under [Jim Crutchfield](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/) in the physics department at UC Davis. The main purpose of this website is to document interesting or useful coding tricks I pick up while working (mostly for my own reference, though ostensibly for posterity) as well as host animations and images to supplement publications.

The website is build using the minima theme for jekyll, and is hosted on github pages.



You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
